## About Me

I’m a researcher in geometry processing, computer graphics/vision, and 3D machine learning. My work seeks new algorithms and new representations to make computing with geometric data easy, efficient, and reliable.

I am almost done with my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Oklahoma, advised by <a href="https://samuelcheng.us/index.html" class="prof-link" target="_blank">
Samuel Cheng</a>. Before that, I completed my Master’s degree at California State University, Fresno, where I worked with Woonki Na on research in power electronics modeling, and was also active in competitive programming.
