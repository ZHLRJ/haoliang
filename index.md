## About Me

I’m a researcher in geometry processing, computer graphics/vision, and 3D machine learning. My work seeks new algorithms and new representations to make computing with geometric data easy, efficient, and reliable. 
I received my PhD in Electrical\&Computer Engineering
 from Carnegie Mellon University advised by Keenan Crane, and was a postdoc in the University of Toronto DGP with Alec Jacobson. Even earlier, I was an undergraduate at Virginia Tech, where I worked with T.M. Murali on computational systems biology, and was active in competitive programming. Outside of work, I’m a big fan of long-distance running, hockey, and cooking.
